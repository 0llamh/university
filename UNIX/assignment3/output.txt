file1:To be, or not to be: that is the question:
file1:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
file1:The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
file1:And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
file1:The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
file1:To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
file1:Must give us pause: there's the respect
file1:For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
file1:The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
file1:The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
file1:The insolence of office and the spurns
file1:That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
file1:But that the dread of something after death,
file1:The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
file1:No traveller returns, puzzles the will
file1:And makes us rather bear those ills we have
file1:Than fly to others that we know not of?
file1:And thus the native hue of resolution
file1:Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
file1:With this regard their currents turn awry,
file1:And lose the name of action. - Soft you now!
