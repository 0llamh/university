					<h5>9/24/2015</h5>
					<p>I chose a bad time to jump into this as I had a test very early this morning; however, now that the weekend is coming up, I'm going to spend a lot of time working on the fine details of the site. I'm only human, I'm only one person, and I'm learning as I go. I am by no means a professional (....yet).</p>

					<h3>This is a work in progress</h3>
					<p>There will be more to come. This entire project did not even exist as an idea a few weeks ago. I am still ironing out some kinks after learning HTML/CSS in just a few days. Give me a little bit of time and things will look a lot prettier, I promise! :D</p>

					<h3>"Who are you?"</h3>
					<p>Good question, stranger. My name is Cameron, and currently, I am an undergraduate student at Florida State University studying both Computer Science and Criminology. I'm following my passion to hopefully create an enjoyable career down the road. This is an attempt to teach myself web development and security. I hope you enjoy.</p>
